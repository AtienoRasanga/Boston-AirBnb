Udacity-Communicating to StakeHolders
1. Motivation For Project
This project is for analysing Boston Airbnb Dataset. Airbnb has gained popularity over the past few years and it would be interesting to explore the landscape in Boston. 

2. Libraries Used
I used python libraries for data analysis such as Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, Seaborn and WordCount 

3. Dataset
This project made use of three datasets from the airbnb repository: Listings, Reviews and Calendar Data

4. Summary of Results
The Boston Airbnb Landscape seems to be very robust with many people using it as a main commercial source of income. The highest earner makes over 6 million dollars. Occupancies over the time also seem to be very high for the entire year.
